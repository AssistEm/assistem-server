#NOTE:
 Do NOT add code directly into the master branch. Develop in your own branch instead. The process for development is as follows:

1. Create Branch
2. Modify your branch with code
3. Make sure your code works in your branch
4. Merge *down* from master and make sure that it still works
5. Make sure the newly updated code in your branch works
6. Then and only then do you merge from your branch to the master branch.

If we follow this process it will significantly reduce the amount of bugs we have. I think the best way to do this is everyone has their own branch with their name attached to it.

## Building and running
Before you attempt to build and run make sure to install [node.js](http://nodejs.org), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), and [Bower](http://bower.io/) on your computer. Then run:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install

To start the server run:

    $ node server/app.js

*You may need to run command as super user since server runs on port 80*
